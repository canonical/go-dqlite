# go-dqlite v1 (deprecated)

This branch (`master`) was used to develop major version 1 of go-dqlite.
Development of this series has ceased, and if you depend on go-dqlite you
should switch to either [major version 3][v3] (mainline development) or [major
version 2][v2] (LTS release, fixes only). For more information about go-dqlite,
see the [v3 README][v3-readme].

[v2]: https://github.com/canonical/go-dqlite/tree/v2
[v3-readme]: https://github.com/canonical/go-dqlite/blob/v3/README.md
